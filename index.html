                     My name is Treek Duncan. I am a professional chessplayer(I am just above average). My best achievement in a tournament
                     is coming in second place. A lifetime goal is to become a grandmaster and to make history,which is tedious process. My 
                     occupation,as right now, is a carpenter,but my dream job is to become a software engineer.I like the ideal of creation
                     and a lot of coders have the potential to create something great. If you look at it, ideally, the universe is just
                     a input of codes that makes reality function the way it does.

                 <strong> How long have i been coding?</strong> I wrote my first code  at age 17 ,and i am 23 now. Yeah, i should of been outstanding
                 coder right now. But frustration can bring huge delays,and at time, i didn't have the power to youtube ,but things will change.
                 I am a strong believer of always keep moving forward. It is the direction that time always move. Yep, so cool beans.
                 oh, do stuff you are passionate about .This is another sentence because it looks like i need more text ,and click around the page
                 to inspect my work. My skill set below
